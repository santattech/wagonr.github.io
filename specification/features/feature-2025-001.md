### CR-2025-001: Allow to start trip and end trip
Requested by: Santanu Bhattacharya

Feature:
#### What we have at present:
- Real-time location tracking with interactive map
- Destination setting with predefined locations
- Distance calculation and ETA estimation
- Speed monitoring and progress tracking
- Offline-capable PWA with service worker

#### Tasks:
Now we want to add another page for listing trips and, 

1. to allow user to start trip and end trip. 
2. Show the live tracking on the map.
3. On ending the trip, show the summary of the trip including distance traveled, average speed, and duration.
4. Show the live speed also on the map
5. **Battery optimization** with configurable GPS update intervals
6. **Location accuracy indicator** showing GPS signal strength
7. **Auto-save trip data** every few minutes to prevent data loss
8. **Automatic trip detection** (start when moving, end when stationary)
9. In trip history list add option to delete any trip. When trip will be deleted, make sure it is deleting all related locations if those are not required any more.
10. If I access the app from mobile's chrome browser, it will work.  But when I turn the screen off, will it still work to fetch the location from Background?
